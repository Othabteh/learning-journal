## process and designe
You should start by knowing who's your audience, why they use your site, and what information they look to find. Don't forget to start after that with a site maps to allow you to plan the structure of a site. You also need to use wireframes to organize the information that will need to go on each page. Design is a way of communication with your audience. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. Finally, by using size, color, and style you make the differentiation between pieces of information easier.
