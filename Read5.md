# Introduction to CSS 

* External CSS :
 A way to applaying your CSS style on HTML file by placing CSS in a separate file allows the web designer to completely differentiate between content (HTML) and design (CSS). External CSS is a file that contains only CSS code and is saved with a ".css" file extension. This CSS file is then referenced in your HTML using the <link> instead of <style>. If you're confused, don't worry. We are going to walk you through the whole process. When using CSS it is preferable to keep the CSS separate from your HTML.

   <head>
      <title>Using Internal CSS</title>
      <style type="text/css"> body {font-family: arial;background-color: rgb(185,179,175);}h1 {color: rgb(255,255,255);}     
      </style>
   </head>
