#  A Script in JS

* A  script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in  order to achieve a goal. 
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
