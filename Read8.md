# Loops
Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

## The For Loop
The for loop has the following syntax:
~~~
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
~~~
## The while Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
~~~
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
~~~
